## Guidelines

Provide information on the following issues:

- **Choice of Model**

- **Feature Selection**

- **Implementation**

- **Evaluation**

Follow the instructions provided in brackets in the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](baseline_model.ipynb) in this folder.

## Submission

Complete the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](baseline_model.ipynb) to conduct your implmentation of the baseline model.
