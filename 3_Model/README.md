# Model Definition and Evaluation

Due to complexity and imbalance of our dataset we have a two parts here:

- Defining / training / evaluating a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data for the underrepresented classes

  - [Statistical Notebook](data_generation_statistic.ipynb)
  - [CGAN Notebook3](data_generation_cGAN.ipynb)

- Defining / training / evaluating a classifier for predicting cognitive workload
  - [Notebook](model_definition_evaluation)
