## Overview

In this milestone, you will define, implement, and evaluate the machine learning model for your project. Your aim should be to improve upon the baseline model and try different approaches to achieve better performance.

## Guidelines

Provide information on the following issues:

- **Model Selection**

- **Feature Engineering**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **Implementation**

- **Evaluation Metrics**

- **Comparative Analysis**

Follow the instructions provided in brackets in the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](model_definition_evaluation.ipynb) in this folder.

## Submission

Complete the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](model_definition_evaluation.ipynb) to conduct your model implementation and evaluation.
